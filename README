pb52l:  Filter output from your shell to make any X11 terminal OSC 52-capable 

This simple tool makes any X11 terminal capable of copying/pasting text with the
OSC 52 escape sequence. You will need to install xclip tool for this to work
(something like apt-get install xclip).

You can compile like this:

  $ gcc -O3 -o pb52l pb52l.c

Then run like this if you are ssh-ing to a remote machine:

  $ ssh some-machine | ./pb52l

Or like this to use it locally with bash:

  $ bash -l | ./pb52l

Based on https://github.com/matvore/pb52 adopted for xclip tool
